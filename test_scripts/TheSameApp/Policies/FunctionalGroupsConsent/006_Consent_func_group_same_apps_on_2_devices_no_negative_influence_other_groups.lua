-- Proposal:
-- https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0204-same-app-from-multiple-devices.md
-- Description:
-- User consent for functional groups has no incorrect negative influence on functional groups that require other
-- consent prompt for two consented mobile devices with the same mobile applications registered.
--
-- Preconditions:
-- 1) SDL and HMI are started
-- 2) Mobile №1 and №2 are connected to SDL and are consented
-- 3) RPC SendLocation exists only in Group001 according policies and requires user consent ConsentGroup001
--    RPC Show exists only in Group002 according policies and requires user consent ConsentGroup002
-- 4) Application App1 is registered on Mobile №1 and Mobile №2 (two copies of one application)
--
-- Steps:
-- 1) User allows ConsentGroup001 and ConsentGroup002 for App1 on Mobile №1 and Mobile №2
-- Applications App1 from both devices (Mobile №1 and Mobile №2) send to SDL valid SendLocation and Show RPC requests
--   Check:
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №2
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №2
-- 2) User disallows ConsentGroup001 for App1 on Mobile №1
-- Applications App1 from both devices (Mobile №1 and Mobile №2) send to SDL valid SendLocation and Show RPC requests
--   Check:
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №2
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №2
-- 3) User disallows ConsentGroup001 for App1 on Mobile №2
-- Applications App1 from both devices (Mobile №1 and Mobile №2) send to SDL valid SendLocation and Show RPC requests
--   Check:
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №2
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №2
-- 4) User disallows ConsentGroup002 for App1 on Mobile №2
-- Applications App1 from both devices (Mobile №1 and Mobile №2) send to SDL valid SendLocation and Show RPC requests
--   Check:
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №2
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = SUCCESS) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №2
-- 5) User disallows ConsentGroup002 for App1 on Mobile №1
-- Applications App1 from both devices (Mobile №1 and Mobile №2) send to SDL valid SendLocation and Show RPC requests
--   Check:
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends SendLocation(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №2
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №1
--    SDL sends Show(resultCode = USER_DISALLOWED) response to Mobile №2
