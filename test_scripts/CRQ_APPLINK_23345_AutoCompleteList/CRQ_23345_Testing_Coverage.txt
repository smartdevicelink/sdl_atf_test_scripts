Precondtions:
TC_02: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL" 
TC_03: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL"
TC_04: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL"
TC_05: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL. Connection, session and service #7 are initialized for the application the request 
one of the defined in moile API intented to be sent from mobile application with appID. The request is sending with wrong JSON syntax format"
TC_06: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL. Connection, session and service #7 are initialized for the application the request one of the defined in moile API intented to be sent from mobile application with appID. 
The request contains wrong type parameters (single or as the parameters of structures)"
TC_07: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL. Connection, session and service #7 are initialized for the application the request one of the defined in moile API intented to be sent from mobile application with appID. 
The request contains parameter(s) with out-of-bounds array ranges or out-of-bounds values (for a single parameter, or param any type)"
TC_08: "App_1 is SDL-enabled and successfully registred"
TC_09: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL. ChoiseSetID_1 and ChoiseSetID_2 were successfully created."
TC_10: "App sucessfully register and running on SDL"

Steps:
TC_01: "Check the autoCompleteList with “false” value, Must be expanded in keyboardProperties"
TC_02: "Mobile App send SetGlobalProperties_request to SDL with both valid values of autoCompleteText and autoCompleteList 
        SDL must: transfer <autoCompleteList> (without <autoCompleteTest>) param to HMI and receive response with result code success to mobile App"
TC_03: "Mobile App send SetGlobalProperties_request to SDL with valid autoCompleteList and other valid params related to request and this req is allowed by Policies 
       SDL must: transfer SetGlobalProperties with all req params to HMI. Send respond with <resultCode_received_form_HMI> to mobile app"
TC_04: "In case SDL splits the req. from mobile app to several HMI interfaces(VR, TTS and etc), and at least on of the interface doesn't respond during SDL's watchlog
       SDL must: return “GENERIC ERROR, success:false” result to mobile App, include appropriate description into “info” parameter"
TC_05: "Mobile send request to SDL with wrong syntax in JSON
       SDL must: send respond with resultCode “INVALID_DATA”, and success  “false” value"
TC_06: "App send req to SDL with wrong type of params (ex. enum as integer) and include params of structure 
       SDL must: respond with result code “INVALID_DATA”, and success “false” value"
TC_07: "Mobile send request to SDL with out-of-bounds param values (include params of structures) of any types.
      SDL must: send respond with resultCode “INVALID_DATA”, and success  “false” value"
TC_08: "HMI->SDL invalid response, SDL must transfer to mobileApp
      SDL must: log the error internally, SDL->MOB: GENERIC_ERROR (success:false, info: “invalid message received from vehilce”) to mobileApp"
TC_09: "SDL must: respond GENERIC_ERROR (success:false, <info>) to mobileApp"
TC_10: "MOB->SDL, sends SetGlobalProperties_request, without “autoCompleteList” parameter, but with valid other params related to request and this request is allowed by Policies 
      SDL must: transfer SetGlobalProperties with all requested params to HMI, respond with <resultCode_received_from_HMI> to mobile app"

Questions (not posted)
TC_03: "Q1: If request will be disallowed by policies, what will be behaviour of SDL?
        Q2: MOB send SetGlobalProperties with invalid autoCompleteList, behaviour of SDL?"
