TC_19: Check that SDL return “GENERIC ERROR, success:false” result to mobile App, include appropriate description into “info” parameter" if SDL splits the request from mobile application to several HMI interfaces(VR, TTS and etc), and at least on of the interface doesn't respond during SDL's watchlog
TC_20: Check that SDL send respond with result code “INVALID_DATA”, and success  “false” value" if applicaion sent request to SDL with wrong syntax in JSON.
TC_21: Check that SDL send respond with result code “INVALID_DATA”, and success “false” value" if applicaion sent request to SDL with wrong type of params (ex. enum as integer) and include params of structure. 
TC_22: Check that SDL send respond with result code “INVALID_DATA”, and success “false” value" if applicaion sent request to SDL with out-of-bounds param values params of structures of any types.

TC_31: Check that SDL transfers ResetGlobalProperties_request from mobile app to HMI with default value of "autoCompleteList". SDL receives SUCCESS result code from HMI and transfer 'SUCCESS, success:true' to mobile app.
